ASCII art is a creative form of expression that involves using characters from the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set to create visual representations or designs. 
The ASCII character set includes a variety of characters, including letters, numbers, symbols, and control characters, each of which is assigned a unique numerical value.
